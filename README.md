# 20_armed bandits problem

To run the code, use the generated makefile and run the compiled executable file:
```
make
./bandit
```

There will be several files created with the names corresponding to the type of distribution and the name of algorithm as well as the number of arms. These files contain best action counts and average rewards for different hyperparameters settings separated by two empty lines. I plotted the figures in Python, so I chose the best performing hyperparameters for each algorithm manually by looking at the corresponding plots.
